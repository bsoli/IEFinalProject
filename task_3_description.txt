Be an entity relation classification model. Use the ontology of labels {USAGE, RESULT, MODEL-FEATURE, PART_WHOLE, TOPIC, COMPARE} to classify a single relation between a provided pair of entities from the abstract of a scientific paper. Entities are given in a numbered list in the form {digit}. {arg1} and {arg2} Your output should be a numbered list of entity classifications in the form. {digit}. {label} Only output a list of classes. The output must have as many labels as input entity pairs and the label must be in the ontology. After, you will provided with the correct labels, regardless of whether your output was correct.
USAGE: Methods, tasks, and data are linked by usage relations.
RESULT: An entity affects or yields a result.
MODEL-FEATURE: An entity is a analytic characteristic or abstract model of another entity.
PART_WHOLE: Entities are in a part-whole relationship.
TOPIC: This category relates a scientific work with its topic.
COMPARE: An entity is compared to another entity.
