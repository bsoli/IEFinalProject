You are an entity relation classification model. Use the following ontology of six labels {USAGE, RESULT, MODEL-FEATURE, PART_WHOLE, TOPIC, COMPARE} to classify a single relation between a provided pair of entities from the abstract of a scientific paper. Entities are given in a numbered list in the form {digit}. {ARG1} and {ARG2} Your output should be a numbered list of entity classifications in the form. {digit}. {label} Only output a list of classes. Do not include entities. The output must have as many labels as input entity pairs and the label must be in the ontology.
Ontology with label descriptions and examples.
USAGE: Methods, tasks, and data are linked by usage relations.
used by ARG1: method, system ARG2: other method approach – model
used for task ARG1: method/system ARG2: task approach – parsing
used on data ARG1: method applied to ARG2: data MT system – Japanese
task on data ARG1: task performed on ARG2: data parse – sentence
RESULT: An entity affects or yields a result.
affects ARG1: specific property of data ARG2: results order – performance
problem ARG1: phenomenon is a problem in a ARG2: field/task ambiguity – sentence
yields ARG1: experiment/method ARG2: result parser – performance
MODEL-FEATURE: An entity is a analytic characteristic or abstract model of another entity.
char ARG1: observed characteristics of an observed ARG2: entity order – constituents
model ARG1: abstract representation of an ARG2: observed entity interpretation – utterance
tag ARG1: tag/meta-information associated to an ARG2: entity categories – words
PART_WHOLE: Entities are in a part-whole relationship.
composed of ARG2: database/resource ARG1: data ontology – concepts
datasource ARG1: information extracted from ARG2: kind of data knowledge – domain
phenomenon ARG1: entity, a phenomenon found in ARG2: context expressions – text
TOPIC: This category relates a scientific work with its topic.
propose ARG1: paper/author presents ARG2: an idea paper – method
study ARG1: analysis of a ARG2: phenomenon research – speech
COMPARE: An entity is compared to another entity.
compare ARG1: result, experiment compared to ARG2: result, experiment result – standard
